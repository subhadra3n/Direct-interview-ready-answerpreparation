About project
1. Catalog Service

Manages all product data (add, update, delete, fetch products).

Other services or frontend call it via REST APIs to get product info.

2. Notification Service

Sends emails or push notifications (e.g., new product alerts).

Other services call it synchronously via REST API when a notification is needed.
