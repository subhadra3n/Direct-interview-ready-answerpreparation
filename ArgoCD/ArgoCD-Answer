Argo CD – Real-Time Project Explanation

1.In our project, we used Argo CD as a GitOps-based Continuous Delivery tool to deploy applications to Kubernetes.
All Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts were stored in a Git repository, which acted as the single source of truth.

2.Argo CD was configured to continuously monitor the Git repository.
3.Whenever any changes occurs such as an image tag update, replica change, or configuration update—Argo CD automatically synchronized those changes to the Kubernetes 
cluster. In critical environments like production, we used manual approval sync, while dev and QA used auto-sync.

4.We managed multiple environments and multiple Kubernetes clusters (dev, QA, prod) using a single Argo CD instance. Each environment had a separate Argo CD application
mapped to its respective Git path or branch.

5.Argo CD provided a web-based UI where we could:

Visually track application health and sync status

Identify configuration drift

Trigger manual syncs and rollbacks

If someone made a manual change directly in the cluster, Argo CD detected the drift and reverted it back to the Git-defined state, ensuring consistency and auditability
.

For rollbacks, we simply reverted the Git commit, and Argo CD redeployed the previous stable version automatically.

ARGOCD Architecture:
Argo CD Components:

argocd-server → Web UI + API.
application-controller → Syncs Git with cluster.
repo-server → Fetches Git repo, processes Helm/Kustomize.
Redis → Cache for performance.

__________________________________________How Argo CD Works **
You define your Kubernetes YAML in Git.
Argo CD pulls those files.
It compares Git (desired state) vs Cluster (live state).
If different → you sync manually or auto-sync.
If auto-sync + self-heal → it updates automatically.
