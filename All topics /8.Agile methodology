"In our project, we follow the Agile methodology using the Scrum framework to manage s/w development and delivery process effectively.
Overall Work is organized into short iterations called sprints, usually its duration to complete two to four weeks long. 
Each sprint is further broken down into user stories,which represent customer-focused requirements. 
These stories are allocated to team members, and typically a story takes one to two weeks to complete.

We conduct daily stand-up meetings to share progress, identify blockers issues, and keep the team aligned. 
Additionally, every Friday we have a call to review story progress, clarify dependencies, and ensure we are on track with sprint commitments.




This approach typically followed in our project ensures high-quality delivery to customers. It combines Agile principles with practical delivery 
processes, making it highly effective for modern software development in live en environments."
