What is imagepullbackoff?
ImagePullBackOff happens when Kubernetes is unable to pull the container image from the container registry and keeps retrying .   (with a back-off delay).
it occurs due to:


Wrong image name or tag

Image not available in registry

Authentication failure (private registry)

Missing imagePullSecrets

Network/DNS issues

Troubleshooting:
1.Check pod status & describe the pod
Check Events for:
Image not found
Unauthorized
ErrImagePull

2.Verify image name & tag
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml

3.Check imagePullSecrets (private registry)
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml
kubectl get secret

4,Check registry access / network
kubectl describe node <node-name>

5.Fix image or secret and restart it
