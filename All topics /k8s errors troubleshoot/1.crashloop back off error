1.Crashloop back off
crashloop back off happens when a container repeateldly crashes Kubernetes keeps trying to restart it. 
it occurs due to
wrong commands,  failing liveness or readiness probes, resource limits being exceeded or application erroes

Troubleshoot CrashLoopBackOff

1.check with pod status & describe the pod by using 
commands kubectl get pods
          kubectl describe pod <pod-name> to know 
Events,
Exit code
Last state
Reason(OOMKilled, Error etc)

2.check conatiner logs
by using comamnd-------kubectl logs <pod-name>
                to check
Application error
DB connection failures
port binding
permission denied error
missing env variables

3.now verify application configuration---by login in to the pod-----
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> --bin/bash
4.check liveness & Readiness probes---------Ensure probe paths, ports, and timings are correct.(

  Events section at the bottom

You will see messages like:

Liveness probe failed
Readiness probe failed
Startup probe failed

  5.check resource limits----------Verify CPU and memory requests/limits are sufficient.(Resource limits can be checked using kubectl describe pod and kubectl top pod comman)
6.check image & startup commands-----------Confirm the correct image, tag, entrypoint, and command are used.
  (Image and startup commands can be verified using kubectl describe pod or kubectl get pod -o yaml by checking the image, command, and args fields.)
  fix issue & redeploy.
