what is memory leak
Memory leak happens when an application keeps using memory but does not release it, eventually causing the container to be killed (OOMKilled).

Troubleshooting Steps:
1.Check pod status & Describe the pod to check for events
Look for OOMKilled(out of memory) or frequent restarts.

2.Check container logs-----Look for memory allocation errors.

3.Check memory usage---------kubectl top pod <pod-name> --containers

4.Check application metrics

Use Prometheus, Grafana, or app-specific metrics.

Look at heap memory, garbage collection, and object counts.
5.Check resource limits--------Ensure limits are sufficient.
6.Fix application code

Release unused objects

Optimize caching
7.Redeploy pod-----by using command
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployn name>

| Command                                                | Why we use it                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`                        | Delete a single pod to force Kubernetes to recreate it using existing spec          |
| `kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>` | Restart all pods in a deployment in a controlled rolling fashion                    |
| Both                                                   | Used to redeploy pods after fixing errors, updating configs, or applying new images |
