1."In our project, we use Ansible for configuration management and automation tasks like installing packages, managing users, updating configurations, 
and restarting services across multiple servers at the same time.

2. Ansible is agentless — so we don’t need to install any extra software on the target machines. It only requires SSH access and Python, 
which makes it lightweight and easy to use.
3.We always ensure that our playbooks are idempotent,so  they can be executed multiple times without causing unwanted changes
if the system is already in the desired state.

4.For security, we use Ansible valut to store sensitive data and encrypt them during deployments
5.Regarding inventory management, we use both static and dynamic inventories:

Static Inventory for lower environments (like dev/test), where we manually maintain list of  ips or hostnames  in a file like hosts.ini 

Dynamic Inventory in production, where we integrate with AWS inventory plugins or inventory scripts to automatically fetch EC2 instances 

dynamically using tags and instance states.

 Ansible plays very important role for configuration management,it  helped us to reduce manual effort, speeds up deployments, and 
improve consistency across environments
