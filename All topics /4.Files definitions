what is manifest file in k8s?
A Kubernetes manifest file is a text file written in YAML format that contains a set of instructions to define and manage Kubernetes resources like Pods, 
Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps. 
It declares the desired state of these resources in the cluster, such as what containers to run, how many replicas to maintain, and how to configure networking.
Kubernetes reads this file and automatically creates or updates the cluster to match the specified state. 
it acts like a blueprint for Kubernetes to understand what needs to be deployed and managed, enabling declarative and repeatable infrastructure management.

what is docker file?
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It acts like a blueprint specifying the base image, application code,
dependencies, environment variables, and commands to run inside the container. When you run the docker build command, Docker reads the Dockerfile line by line,
executing each instruction to assemble an image layer by layer.
This process ensures consistent, repeatable, and portable container images that run the same way across different environments.
What is Jenkins file?
A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains a series of stages and steps to define a Jenkins pipeline. It automates the build, test, and
deployment processes consistently across different environments to effectively maintain and streamline the CI/CD process.
