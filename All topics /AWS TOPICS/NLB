Structure to create LB-------
1.create Target group------add listners then it route traffic to instances
2.Create LB and attach the Target groups in it

What is LB?
A Load Balancer in AWS is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets 
(like EC2 instances, containers, or IPs) across one or more Availability Zones. It helps achieve high availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability.
It also improves performance and reliability by evenly distributing traffic and automatically handling failures.

Types of AWS Load Balancers
Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
Supports host-based and path-based routing
Good for web apps, REST APIs, microservices
Network Load Balancer (NLB)

Works at Layer 4 (TCP)
Very high performance, low latency
Suitable for real-time apps, gaming, VoIP

scaling ec2 instances--------
i.Horizontal scaling------it scales the no of instances
Horizontal scaling is used to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic or load by using Auto Scaling Groups.
It improves availability and fault tolerance by distributing traffic across multiple instances.

ii.Vertical scaling---it scales the resources for an existing instance
Vertical scaling (scaling up or down) involves increasing or decreasing the resources of an existing EC2 instance, such as CPU, memory, or storage.

For example, you can increase the instance size (e.g., from t2.micro → t3.large).

This usually requires stopping the instance before changing the instance type.

Vertical scaling increases the capacity of a single instance, unlike horizontal scaling which adds more instances.

What is ALB?
ALB is an AWS service that operates at Layer 7 (physical Layer) of the  OSI model and routes HTTP and HTTPS traffic to targets such as EC2 instances, 
IP addresses, or ECS.
based on content-based rules, such as URL path, host headers, or HTTP methods

It also supports features like SSL termination, sticky sessions, and WebSocket connections.

What is NLB?
NLB is an AWS service that operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the  OSI model and routes TCP (and optionally UDP) traffic to targets such as EC2 instances, 
IP addresses, or ECS.
Designed to handle millions of requests per second with very low latency.
Ideal for real-time applications, gaming, streaming, or low-latency microservices.
