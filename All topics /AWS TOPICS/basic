What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning,
and maintaining physical data centers and servers, organizations can access technology services such as compute power, storage, and databases from a cloud provider.
