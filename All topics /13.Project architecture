1.When a user accesses the application through a browser,
the request first goes through DNS resolution, 
2. Route 53 resolves the domain name to the Application Load Balancer (ALB) based on DNS Configured host zone records
3.The Application Load Balancer (ALB) is placed in public subnets and configured with an SSL certificate to terminate HTTPS traffic.
4.Based on host-based and path-based rules, the ALB forwards the request to the Kubernetes Ingress controller,The Ingress controller then routes the request
to the appropriate Service according to the Ingress rules.
5.The Service load-balances traffic across healthy Pods. 
The Pod running the application processes the request, communicates with the database and other microservices, builds the response, and sends it back to the user.
