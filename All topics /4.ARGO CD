1--------Argo CD:
our project, we used Argo CD  to Continously deploy applications to Kubernetes.
All Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts were stored in Git, (which acted as the single source of truth.)

2.Argo CD was configured to continuously monitor the Git repository.

3..We used a single Argo CD instance to manage multiple Kubernetes environments like dev, QA, and production.
Each environment had its own Argo CD application, connected to a specific Git branch or folder.



4.when we enable the autosync policy, Whenever there were changes such as image tag updates, replica count changes, or configuration updates,
Argo CD automatically synced those changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
5.If someone made manual changes directly in the Kubernetes cluster, Argo CD detected the drift and reverted it back to the Git-defined state,
ensuring consistency and control.


.Argo CD provided a web-based UI where we could:

i.Track application health

ii.Check whether Git and the cluster were in sync

iii.Manually trigger syncs when required

iv.Rollback to a previous version if something went wrong


6.For rollbacks, we simply reverted the Git commit, and Argo CD automatically redeployed the previous stable version.

2--------------we have Argocd right, we have ECR Right whenever you push the Image to Eck, How does ArgoCD will notify, How does ArgoCD gets to know. 
there is a Image change & how does ArgoCD gets to gets to know. It needs to deploy on the top of which tubernetes?
------
Argo CD watches Git, not container registries.

So Argo CD only knows about changes if the Git repository is updated.
__________


If you want Argo CD to monitor ECR automatically:

Install Image Updater:

Argo CD Image Updater (Optional)

Argo CD has a companion called Argo CD Image Updater.

It monitors container registries like ECR.

When a new image tag appears:

It updates the Git repository automatically.

Then Argo CD sees the Git change and syncs it to Kubernetes.
_____________
Where does Argo CD deploy?

Argo CD deploys to the Kubernetes cluster it is connected to.

When creating an Argo CD Application, you define:

Target cluster (can be dev, QA, or production)

Target namespace

So the workflow is always: Git → Argo CD → Kubernetes cluster
