1.Introduction/self intro:

.Thank you for giving me this oppurtunity,
2. my name is Subhadra, and I'm from Hyderabad. I’m currently working as a DevOps Engineer at Agile Ideas Pvt. Ltd., 
with overall  3.6 years of experience in the DevOps domain.

3.Throughout, I’ve gained extensive knoweledge in streamlining software development and deployment processes, 
along with automating infrastructure.


4.My technical skill set includes creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins,"Multi-cloud infrastructure management on AWS, Azure,
and GCP with Terraform."
I automate software installation configuration management using Ansible, we acheive container orchestration,Auto scaling,self healing and 
lb with Kubernetes,monitor infrastructure with Prometheus and Grafana,and 
shell scripting for automating repetitive tasks.


6.Currently, I’m working on an eCommerce project that follows a microservices architect with 55+ micro services,we manage cart & notifications micro services.
comming to My roles & responsibilities (include managing and deploying Java-based applications with a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.)


o   I am responsible for monitoring infrastructure health by logging into the system and performing regular health checks.
o	We use Prometheus to collect the metrics and Grafana to visuallize the application & infra health, integrated with Node Exporter and Blackbox, to track system metrics and application health.
o	If any alerts or incidents occur, I analyze them and take appropriate action.
o	& my next task is to -----
2.	and we also 
o	manage and maintain CI/CD pipelines, ensuring smooth deployment and delivery processes.
o	I review and modify pipelines as per project requirements, ensuring reliability and performance.
o	And For new projects, we write a declarative pipeline script to define and create the required stages."
3.	multi-Cloud Infrastructure Management (AWS,Azure,GCP):
          in this AWS, we 
          
           i    set up infrastructure for various envs such as dev, testing, staging, and production environments."
          ii.Based on project requirements, we automate the installation and configuration of pre-required softwares using Ansible. In d/f environments
         
& we also work on automation 
4.	
As part of automation initiatives, I have created scripts for tasks such as log rotation, cleaning  old backups, process monitoring, and cron job scheduling. 
Python’s versatility allows me to write more complex automation scripts for cloud resource management, API interactions, and integration with infrastructure tools.
○ Schedule automated jobs using cron for maintenance activities and monitoring disk usage with 
automated alerts,significantly reducing manual effort.


5.In k8s, we creating and managing existing clusters as per project req to ensure high availability and stability. 
I monitor pod health, troubleshoot failures, and provide a stable environment for users and clients.
I also handle microservices deployments using YAML manifests and Helm charts, with ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration, and use ClusterIP,
LoadBalancer, and Ingress for service exposure. Autoscaling and rolling updates are configured to ensure performance and zero downtime.

6.Reporting & Client Updates:
"Additionally, I prepare monthly client reports that provide system reliability, security, performance, and backup success info."


Thats all bout my profile thank you
