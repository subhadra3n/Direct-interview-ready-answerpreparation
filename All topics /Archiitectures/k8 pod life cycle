k8 pod life cycle:
1.When we apply kubectl apply -f file.yaml, the request is sent to the Kubernetes API server.
2.The API server validates the request and stores the pod object in ETCD
3.Initially, the pod remains in Pending state because no node is assigned.
4.The scheduler then watches for unscheduled pods and selects the best node based on
CPU & memory availability

Node taints and tolerations

Affinity/anti-affinity rules

Resource requests & limits
5.It then selects the best suitable node and updates the Pod object with the node name.
This updated information is again saved back to ETCD via the API server.
6.The kubelet running on that node detects the scheduled pod, calls the container runtime, pulls the image, and starts the container.
the entire pod lifecycle state is continuously updated and stored in ETCD.
