Monitoring:
In our project, we use Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize application and infrastructure health, mainly focusing on Kubernetes environments. This setup gives us real-time, end-to-end visibility across the platform.

Metrics Collection

Prometheus gathers metrics from:

Kubernetes nodes using node-exporter

Cluster objects using kube-state-metrics

Application endpoints exposed via /metrics

We monitor:

CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage

Pod and node health

Application metrics like latency, throughput, and error rates

Visualization

Grafana is integrated with Prometheus to create:

Cluster-level dashboards

Application performance dashboards

Resource utilization views

These dashboards help teams quickly identify issues and track performance trends over time.

Alerting

We configure alert rules in Prometheus for:

High CPU or memory usage

Pod crash loops

Latency spikes and error rate increases

Alerts are routed through Alertmanager and sent to:

Slack

Email

PagerDuty

This ensures the right team gets notified immediately for faster incident response.
