Monitoring:
In our project, we use Prometheus to collect metrics and Grafana to visualize application and infrastructure health, 
mainly focusing on Kubernetes and AWS environments. This setup gives us real-time, end-to-end visibility.

Metrics Collection:
Prometheus gathers data from Kubernetes nodes (using kube-state-metrics and node-exporter), application endpoints (/metrics), and 
cloud resources like EC2 and Docker (via exporters). We track CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, pod health, and key app metrics like latency and 
error rates.

Visualization:
Grafana connects to Prometheus and provides interactive dashboards for infrastructure, clusters, and apps. These dashboards help teams spot issues 
quickly and monitor performance over time.

Alerting:
Alerts are set up in Prometheus for things like high CPU or memory, crash loops, or latency spikes. Prometheus Alertmanager sends
notifications to Slack, email, or PagerDuty—so the right people can act fast.

AWS Integration:
(For AWS services (like EC2, RDS, ELB), we use CloudWatch alongside Prometheus for extra metrics, logs, and alarms—especially where exporters aren’t
available.) not req

AWS Integration: "For AWS-managed services like RDS, ELB, and NAT Gateways, where we cannot install agents, we use CloudWatch along with Prometheus.
We use the CloudWatch Exporter to pull these 'black-box' metrics into our Prometheus ecosystem. This allows us to correlate 
application-level logs and metrics with underlying AWS infrastructure health—especially for monitoring database connections and load balancer 5XX errors."
