Helm:
Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment and management. 
Instead of manually applying multiple YAML files, Helm  bundles all manifest files, templates,configuration values 
 into a
single package called a Helm Chart

A Helm Chart has a standard structure with Chart.yaml for metadata, values.yaml for configurations, templates/ for Kubernetes manifests 
with placeholders, and an optional charts/ folder for dependencies. This makes manifests reusable and parameterized,

so we only update values.yaml instead of editing every file.we can deploy the same application across Dev, Staging, and Production without rewriting code.

Helm provides Release Management. Every time you install or upgrade a chart, Helm creates a new revision. 
It tracks changes in a history log, allowing you to perform instant rollbacks to a previous stable state if something goes wrong.

So overall, Helm reduces complexity, enforces consistency, improves scalability, and makes Kubernetes deployments production-ready.”
