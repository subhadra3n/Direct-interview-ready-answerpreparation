Zero down time deployment strategies:
i.Rolling updates
“Zero-downtime deployment means releasing updates without affecting users. We follow deployment strategies like blue-green, canary, or rolling updates.
For example, in Kubernetes, I use rolling updates to gradually replace pods, so most of the service remains live while the new version rolls out.

Next, I manage traffic carefully. Load balancers and service meshes route requests only to healthy instances, ensuring users don’t face errors if
something goes wrong. I continuously monitor the system using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track latency, errors, and performance.

In CI/CD pipelines, we handle builds, deployments, health checks, and automated rollbacks, so if an issue arises, we can revert to the stable

version quickly without manual intervention.
