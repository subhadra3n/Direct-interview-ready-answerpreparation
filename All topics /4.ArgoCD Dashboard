1️⃣ Argo CD Dashboard Overview

When you open the Argo CD UI (usually via https://<argocd-server>), you get a web-based interface that shows the state of your applications and 
Kubernetes clusters.

2️⃣ Key Sections / Views
a) Applications List

Shows all Argo CD applications you’ve created.

Columns typically include:

App Name

Health Status (Healthy, Degraded, Progressing)

Sync Status (Synced, OutOfSync)

Cluster / Namespace the app is deployed to

You can click an application to see detailed info.

b) Application Details

When you open an app:

Tree View of Resources: Shows all Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Pods, etc.) deployed by this application in a
hierarchical view.

Sync Status:

Synced → live cluster matches Git

OutOfSync → live cluster differs from Git

Health Status:

Healthy → pods running and ready

Degraded → pods failed or resources not ready

Progressing → deployment in progress

c) Sync Options

Manual Sync: Apply the current Git state to the cluster.

Auto-Sync: You can enable auto-sync to automatically deploy Git changes.

Rollback: Revert to a previous application version.

d) History / Revision

Shows past syncs with:

Git commit SHA

Time of deployment

Sync status

Allows rollback to a previous commit if needed

e) Logs & Events

Shows events for deployments like pods failing, rolling updates, or sync operations.

Helps troubleshoot why a resource is out of sync or degraded.

f) Cluster & Repo Management

From the dashboard, you can also manage:

Clusters connected to Argo CD

Repositories Argo CD is monitoring

g) Optional: Image Updater / Notifications

If integrated with Argo CD Image Updater, you can see which images are outdated or updated.

Notifications (Slack, Teams, Email) can be configured for sync and health events.

✅ Interview-Friendly Summary

The Argo CD dashboard shows a list of applications with their health and sync status, provides a tree view of deployed resources, shows deployment history and 
revisions, allows manual or automatic syncs, enables rollbacks, and gives access to logs/events for troubleshooting. It also allows managing connected clusters and 
Git repositories, giving a full view of the Kubernetes deployments managed via GitOps.
