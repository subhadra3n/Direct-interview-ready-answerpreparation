Container port is the internal port where the application runs. Host port is the external port exposed to the outside world. Container port usually
remains fixed based on the application, while the host port can be different and we choose it based on availability.

docker create only creates the container but doesn’t start it. docker run creates and starts the container in a single step,
that’s why docker run is commonly used.
