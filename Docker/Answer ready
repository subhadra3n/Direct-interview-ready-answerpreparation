what is hyperviosor?
“A hypervisor is a virtualization software that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server by sharing its hardware resources.”

what is virtualization?
“Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server by abstracting and sharing hardware resources.
It improves resource utilization, provides isolation between applications, and reduces overall infrastructure costs.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Virtual Machines (VMs)
VMs are virtualize the entire hardware stack using a hypervisor.
 each VM runs a full operating system with its own kernel on top of the host OS. This  makes VMs heavier, slower to start (minutes),
and they consume significantly more CPU, RAM, and storage.

2.2. Containers
Containers virtualize only the operating system. They share the host OS kernel and isolate applications at the process level.
This makes containerslightweight, fast to start (seconds), and less resource usage. They are the ideal choice for modern microservices and rapid deployment

2.what is d/f b/w image and container
Image:
“A Docker image is a read-only snapshot of your application. It contains the application code, dependencies, runtime, libraries, and configuration.
It is built using a Dockerfile and acts as the template for creating containers.”

Container:
“A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It runs the actual application and can store runtime or temporary data.
Containers are isolated, lightweight, and portable.”

3,What is Docker ?
 Docker is a containerization platform, that containerize the image of the applications along with their dependencies, making them lightweight, portable, and environment-independent.
________________________________________________________________________________________
4.Docker architecture?
“Docker follows a client–server architecture.
The Docker Client is what we use to run commands like docker build, docker run, and docker push.
These commands are sent to the Docker Daemon (dockerd), which is the main engine responsible for building images, running containers, managing networks, volumes, and
the entire container lifecycle.

Docker stores and pulls images from a Docker Registry—either Docker Hub or a private registry.
When a container is launched, the daemon pulls the image (if not present), creates the container using storage drivers, sets up networking, and starts the process inside the container.

The key components are:

Docker Client – Sends API requests.

Docker Daemon – Builds, runs, and manages containers.

Docker Images – Read-only templates for containers.

Docker Containers – Running, isolated application environments.

Docker Registry – Stores and distributes container images.

This architecture allows Docker to be fast, lightweight, and highly portable across environments.”
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
5.Docker workflow?

“Docker flow starts with creating a Dockerfile, which defines the application environment and dependencies.
We use the command docker build to create a Docker image from this Dockerfile.

Once the image is ready, we use docker run to create and start a container, which is a lightweight and isolated runtime instance of the application.
The image can be pushed to a Docker registry like Docker Hub for sharing and reuse.

“Docker follows a client–server architecture consisting of three main components: the Docker Client, Docker Daemon, and Docker Registry.
The Docker Client is the command-line tool that sends requests to the Docker Daemon. The Docker Daemon (dockerd) runs in the background and is responsible for building images,
creating containers, and managing Docker objects like networks and volumes.

The daemon interacts with the OS kernel (using namespaces and cgroups) to create and run isolated containers.
Docker Registries store Docker images, which the daemon can pull and run to ensure consistent deployments across environments.
Finally, containers can be managed, scaled, and deployed across different environments, ensuring consistent application delivery.”

Docker follows a client-server architecture consisting of three main components: the Docker Client, Docker Daemon, and Docker Registry. The Docker Client is the 
command-line tool that sends commands to the Docker Daemon, which runs as a background service managing Docker objects like containers, images, networks, and volumes.
The Docker Daemon communicates with the OS kernel to create and run containers. Docker Registry stores Docker images that can be pulled and deployed by the daemon, 
enabling consistent 
application delivery across environments. This architecture enables efficient container management, scalability, and portability in modern DevOps workflows.
