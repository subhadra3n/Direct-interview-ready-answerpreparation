1. Virtual Machines (VMs)
VMs are virtualize the entire hardware stack using a hypervisor.
 each VM runs a full operating system with its own kernel on top of the host OS. This  makes VMs heavier, slower to start (minutes),
and they consume significantly more CPU, RAM, and storage. However, they provide maximum security isolation because the OS kernels are completely separated.

2.2. Containers
Containers virtualize only the operating system, specifically the user space. They share the host OS kernel and isolate applications at the process level using technologies like  namespaces.
This architecture makes containers extremely lightweight, fast to start (seconds), and highly efficient in resource usage. They are the ideal choice for modern microservices and rapid deployment

2.what is d/f b/w image and container
Image:
“A Docker image is a read-only snapshot of your application. It contains the application code, dependencies, runtime, libraries, and configuration.
It is built using a Dockerfile and acts as the template for creating containers.”

Container:
“A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It runs the actual application and can store runtime or temporary data.
Containers are isolated, lightweight, and portable.”
