1. Virtual Machines (VMs)
VMs are virtualize the entire hardware stack using a hypervisor.
 each VM runs a full operating system with its own kernel on top of the host OS. This  makes VMs heavier, slower to start (minutes),
and they consume significantly more CPU, RAM, and storage.

2.2. Containers
Containers virtualize only the operating system. They share the host OS kernel and isolate applications at the process level.
This makes containerslightweight, fast to start (seconds), and less resource usage. They are the ideal choice for modern microservices and rapid deployment

2.what is d/f b/w image and container
Image:
“A Docker image is a read-only snapshot of your application. It contains the application code, dependencies, runtime, libraries, and configuration.
It is built using a Dockerfile and acts as the template for creating containers.”

Container:
“A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It runs the actual application and can store runtime or temporary data.
Containers are isolated, lightweight, and portable.”

3,What is Docker ?
Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications,
which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as DockerHub

4.Docker architecture?
“Docker follows a client–server architecture.
The Docker Client is what we use to run commands like docker build, docker run, and docker push.
These commands are sent to the Docker Daemon (dockerd), which is the main engine responsible for building images, running containers, managing networks, volumes, and
the entire container lifecycle.

Docker stores and pulls images from a Docker Registry—either Docker Hub or a private registry.
When a container is launched, the daemon pulls the image (if not present), creates the container using storage drivers, sets up networking, and starts the process inside the container.

The key components are:

Docker Client – Sends API requests.

Docker Daemon – Builds, runs, and manages containers.

Docker Images – Read-only templates for containers.

Docker Containers – Running, isolated application environments.

Docker Registry – Stores and distributes container images.

This architecture allows Docker to be fast, lightweight, and highly portable across environments.”
