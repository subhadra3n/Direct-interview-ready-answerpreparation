SRE & Devopos 

DevOps engineers focus on automating infrastructure and building CI/CD pipelines to deliver features faster and more reliably.


SRE:
“SRE engineers focus on system reliability, security, monitoring, incident management, and enforcing SLOs and SLAs to maintain production stability and performance.”

______________________________
tasks:
“Daily, I review monitoring dashboards and alerts,
resolve production incident tickets, perform root cause analysis, Optimize auto-scaling and resource usage,
support deployments, and continuously improve reliability through automating repetitive tasks .”
_________________________________________________________________________

what type of issue we grt in prod & how we resolve them?
“In production, we typically get alerts for availability, latency, resource usage, application errors, and infrastructure issues. When an L2 alert occurs, I first acknowledge it in PagerDuty, 
validate the impact by checking metrics and logs, execute mitigation steps such as restarting pods, scaling resources, or rolling back deployments, and finally perform a root cause analysis to prevent recurrence.”

| Type of Alert              | Example                                 | Cause / Notes                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Availability / Uptime**  | Service down, 5xx errors                | Pod crash, server down, network issue      |
| **Performance / Latency**  | API latency > 500ms                     | Slow database queries, overloaded pods     |
| **Resource Utilization**   | CPU > 80%, Memory > 75%, Disk full      | Need scaling, memory leak, runaway process |
| **Application Errors**     | High error rate, exceptions             | Code bug, misconfiguration                 |
| **Infrastructure / Node**  | Node unreachable, disk I/O high         | Node failure, network issue                |
| **Security / Compliance**  | Unauthorized access attempts            | Failed login, misconfigured firewall       |
| **Custom Business Alerts** | Orders failing, payment gateway timeout | Application-level logic failure            |

Perform voice pipeline checks (SIP/STT/TTS/WebSockets) and ensure call-flow reliability:
How You Ensure Call-Flow Reliability
Step 1: Health Checks

Verify SIP servers are reachable, registered, and responding

Test STT/TTS services for latency and accuracy

Ensure WebSocket connections are stable

Step 2: Automated Testing

Run synthetic calls (real-time scripts) to simulate call flows

Validate audio quality, transcription accuracy, and TTS playback

Step 3: Monitoring & Alerts

Monitor key metrics:

Call success/failure rate

Latency (end-to-end)

Audio quality (jitter, packet loss)

WebSocket disconnects

Tools: Grafana, Prometheus, CloudWatch, ELK

Step 4: Incident Handling

On alert (failed call or pipeline error):

Check SIP registration logs

Test STT/TTS services individually

Check WebSocket connectivity

Restart service pods or scale resources if needed

Step 5: Continuous Improvement

Optimize STT/TTS models and service resources

Automate health-check scripts

Tune SIP server configs for reliability

Ensure high availability with failover setup

3️⃣ Example Interview Answer

“I perform end-to-end voice pipeline checks, including SIP, STT, TTS, and WebSocket services, to ensure call-flow reliability. I monitor key metrics such as call success
rates, latency, and audio quality, respond to pipeline alerts by investigating logs and restarting or scaling services if needed, and continuously improve the system through automation and failover mechanisms.”

Update runbooks, documentation, and post-incident reports
| Item                                 | Purpose                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Runbooks**                         | Step-by-step guides for handling known incidents or tasks (helps on-call engineers resolve issues quickly)       |
| **Documentation**                    | System designs, configurations, deployment steps, or SOPs (helps teams onboard and maintain systems efficiently) |
| **Post-Incident Reports (PIR/RCAs)** | Analyze incidents, identify root causes, and recommend preventive actions to avoid recurrence                    |
___________________
“I update runbooks, documentation, and post-incident reports to ensure team knowledge is current. After incidents, I document the root cause, mitigation steps,
and preventive actions, update operational guides accordingly, and share them with the team to improve incident response and system reliability.”

Ensure compliance with SOC2 and HIPAA standards, following secure handling of PHI data:

| Term      | Explanation                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SOC 2** | Service Organization Control standard for data security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy |
| **HIPAA** | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act — ensures protection of PHI (Protected Health Information)            |
| **PHI**   | Sensitive personal health information that must be securely stored, transmitted, and accessed                             |
Goal: Protect sensitive data, comply with regulations, and prevent breaches.
How It’s Achieved (Step-by-Step)

Access Control

Enforce least-privilege access via IAM, RBAC

Audit all access to PHI data

Encryption

Encrypt data at rest (S3, databases) and in transit (TLS/HTTPS, VPNs)

Monitoring & Logging

Log all access to sensitive data

Monitor for suspicious activity

Process & Policy

Follow documented procedures for handling PHI

Conduct regular audits and reviews for SOC2/HIPAA compliance

Incident Response

Detect and respond to security incidents quickly

Report breaches according to regulatory requirements
______
“I ensure compliance with SOC2 and HIPAA by enforcing secure handling of PHI data, including least-privilege access, encryption of data at rest and in transit,
monitoring all access, and following documented procedures. I also participate in audits and ensure that incident response aligns with regulatory requirements.”
