what type of issue we grt in prod & how we resolve them?
“In production, we typically get alerts for availability, latency, resource usage, application errors, and infrastructure issues. When an L2 alert occurs, I first acknowledge it in PagerDuty, 
validate the impact by checking metrics and logs, execute mitigation steps such as restarting pods, scaling resources, or rolling back deployments, and finally perform a root cause analysis to prevent recurrence.”
