SLA, SLO, SLI & Error Budget
__________________________________________________---
SLA (Service Level Agreement)
SLA is a Service Level Agreement,IT is a business commitment made to customers that defines service availability and performance.
(Example: 99.9% uptime per month.
If we violate SLA, there may be financial penalties or service credits.)
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

SLO (Service Level Objective)
SLO is a Service Level Objective, It is a internal reliability target set by engineering teams to ensure we meet SLA.
SLO is kept higher than SLA to provide a safety buffer and avoid SLA breach.
Example: 99.95% successful API requests, P95 latency < 300ms.

SLI (Service Level Indicator)
SLI is a Service Level Indicator, it is a actual metric used to check service performance.
(Examples:
______________________________________________________________________________________
Success request percentage

Error rate

Latency

Pod availability)

SLIs are collected using Prometheus metrics and visualized in Grafana.

Error Budget
Error budget is the allowed failure based on SLO.

Formula:

Error Budget = 1 - SLO


Example:

SLO = 99.9%

Error budget = 0.1%
This means we can afford 43 minutes downtime per month.

If error budget is exhausted, we:

Stop risky deployments

Focus on reliability fixes
