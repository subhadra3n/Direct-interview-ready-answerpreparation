1.what is k8s?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that manages containerized applications. It automates deployment, scaling,
and operations by providing features such as auto-scaling, 
self-healing, rolling updates, and automatic rollbacks, making applications easier to deploy and manage.

what is docekr swarm?
Docker Swarm is a Docker orchestration platform that manages containerized applications across a cluster,
providing scaling, load balancing, and high availability.

what is d/f b/w k8s & docker swarm

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open source container orchestration platform that manages containerized applications. with advanced features like auto-scaling, 
self-healing, and a rich ecosystem.
Docker Swarm is Docker’s orchestration tool that is easy to set up and manage but it provides limited features. compared to k8s, 
Docker swarm lacks in auto scaling & automatic rollbacks which can be performed in the k8s easily
Kubernetes is the industry standard, while Docker Swarm is mainly used for smaller or simpler applications.

what is container orchestration ?
Container orchestration is a process of  automatically  managing the containarized applications across multiple systems.

It handles tasks such as deploying containers, scaling them up or down, load balancing, monitoring, and self-healing when containers fail.

2.k8s architecture?

Kubernetes  follows a  master and worker node  architecture.
(Master Node)

The control plane manages the cluster and makes global decisions.

API Server – Entry point of the cluster; handles all requests

etcd – Key-value store that holds cluster state and configuration

Scheduler – Assigns pods to worker nodes

Controller Manager – Maintains desired state (replicas, nodes, etc.)
A Kubernetes worker node has 4 main components:

Kubelet – Communicates with the control plane and ensures pods are running

Container Runtime – Runs the containers (Docker, containerd, CRI-O)

Kube-proxy – Handles networking and service load balancing

Pods – Smallest deployable unit that runs one or more containers
______________________________________________
API SERVER:
The API Server is the main component of a Kubernetes cluster. It handles requests from users (e.g., kubectl commands) and other components.
(It processes commands like kubectl get pods or kubectl get nodes-NOT REQ,) interacts with etcd to retrieve or update the cluster state, and serves as 
the central management point for the cluster.
_________________________________________________________________________
Schedular:
The Scheduler is a master node component that assigns pods to worker nodes.
It watches for newly created pods that are not yet assigned to a node and selects the most suitable node based on factors
like resource availability, CPU/memory requirements, affinity/anti-affinity rules, and taints/tolerations.
Once a node is selected, the Scheduler updates the pod specification so the Kubelet on that node can start the pod.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Controll manager:
The Controller Manager runs controller processes that maintain the desired state of the cluster.
It monitors resources like nodes, pods, and replicas, and takes corrective actions—such as creating, updating, or deleting pods—if the current state differs 
from the desired state.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
ETCD:
etcd is a distributed key-value store that holds the entire cluster state and configuration data.
It allows the master node to store and retrieve cluster information reliably.
