Container → Pod (localhost)
Pod → Pod (Pod IP)
Pod → Service (ClusterIP)
External → NodePort / LoadBalancer
🔹 Interview-Ready 2-Line Answer ⭐
In Kubernetes, pods communicate using a flat network where each pod gets a unique IP.
For stable communication, services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) are used instead of direct pod IPs.

Here is a clean, interview-ready summary design exactly in the style you asked, including same node, different node, and IP change handling 👇

🔹 Kubernetes Pod Communication – Summary Design
1️⃣ Container → Pod (localhost)
Containers inside the same pod

Same network namespace

Communicate using localhost

scss
Copy code
Container → Pod (localhost)
2️⃣ Pod → Pod (Same Node)
Each pod has a unique Pod IP

Communication happens directly using Pod IP

Handled by CNI plugin

scss
Copy code
Pod → Pod (Pod IP)  [Same Node]
✅ Fast communication
❌ Pod IP is temporary

3️⃣ Pod → Pod (Different Node)
Pods still communicate using Pod IP

CNI creates flat network across nodes

No NAT, no routing changes required

scss
Copy code
Pod → Pod (Pod IP)  [Different Node]
✅ Same behavior as same node
❌ Pod IP may change if pod restarts

4️⃣ What If Pod IP Changes?
Pod IP changes when:

Pod restarts

Pod rescheduled to another node

Direct Pod-IP communication breaks

❌ Not reliable for applications

5️⃣ Pod → Service (ClusterIP) [Recommended]
Service provides stable virtual IP

Service load-balances traffic to pods

Automatically updates when Pod IP changes

scss
Copy code
Pod → Service (ClusterIP) → Pod
✅ Works across nodes
✅ Handles Pod IP changes automatically

6️⃣ External → NodePort
Exposes service on every node

Port range: 30000–32767

Uses Node IP + NodePort

sql
Copy code
External → NodeIP:NodePort → Service → Pod
📌 Node IP can be same or different node

7️⃣ External → LoadBalancer
Cloud provider creates external LB

Routes traffic to service

Best for production workloads

sql
Copy code
External → LoadBalancer → Service → Pod
🔹 One-Glance Design Flow (BEST)
css
Copy code
Container → Pod (localhost)
Pod → Pod (Pod IP) [same/different node]
Pod → Service (ClusterIP) [handles IP changes]
External → NodePort / LoadBalancer
🔹 Interview Gold Line ⭐
Pods can communicate directly using Pod IPs across the cluster, but since Pod IPs are ephemeral, Kubernetes Services provide stable networking and automatically handle pod IP changes.
