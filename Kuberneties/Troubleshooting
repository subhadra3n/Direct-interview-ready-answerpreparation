Common Kubernetes Troubleshooting (Interview Revision)
1️⃣ Pod Pending

Meaning: Pod is created but not scheduled on any node

Check:

Insufficient node resources (CPU / Memory)

NodeSelector / NodeAffinity mismatch

Taints on node without matching tolerations

PVC not bound to PV

ResourceQuota exceeded

Node in NotReady or SchedulingDisabled

Commands:

kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pvc

2️⃣ CrashLoopBackOff

Meaning: Container starts and crashes repeatedly

Check:

Application crash (bad config / code issue)

Wrong environment variables

DB connection failure / connection leak

Memory leak → OOMKilled

Liveness probe misconfiguration

Missing ConfigMap / Secret

Port mismatch in app vs container spec

Commands:

kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

3️⃣ ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull

Meaning: Image cannot be pulled

Check:

Wrong image name or tag

Image does not exist in registry

Missing or wrong imagePullSecrets

Registry authentication failure

Network / DNS issue on node

Rate limit issues (Docker Hub)

Commands:

kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get secret

4️⃣ OOMKilled

Meaning: Container killed due to memory limit exceeded

Check:

Memory limit too low

Application memory leak

JVM heap size not aligned with container limit

Commands:

kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl top pod

5️⃣ Pod Not Ready

Meaning: Pod is running but not receiving traffic

Check:

Readiness probe failure

Application startup delay

Dependency service not reachable

Wrong service port / targetPort

Commands:

kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>

6️⃣ Service Not Reachable

Meaning: Pod is running but service traffic fails

Check:

Service selector does not match pod labels

TargetPort mismatch

Pod not Ready

NetworkPolicy blocking traffic

Commands:

kubectl get svc
kubectl describe svc <svc-name>
kubectl get endpoints <svc-name>

7️⃣ HPA Not Scaling

Meaning: Replicas do not increase/decrease

Check:

Metrics Server not running

CPU requests not defined

HPA min/max limits reached

Application not generating load

Commands:

kubectl get hpa
kubectl describe hpa
kubectl top pods

8️⃣ Node Not Ready

Meaning: Node unavailable for scheduling

Check:

Kubelet stopped

Disk pressure / memory pressure

Network issues

Cloud provider issues (EC2, VM failure)

Commands:

kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node <node-name>

9️⃣ Quota Reached

Meaning: Namespace resource limit exceeded

Check:

CPU / memory quota exhausted

Pod / PVC count limit reached

Commands:

kubectl get resourcequota
kubectl describe resourcequota

🔟 High Latency / Performance Issues

Check:

Insufficient pod replicas

Missing HPA

CPU throttling due to low limits

Network latency between services

DB slowness

1️⃣1️⃣ Secrets / Config Issues

Check:

Secret or ConfigMap missing

Wrong key name

Incorrect mount path

Accidentally logging secrets in application logs

1️⃣2️⃣ SSL / Certificate Issues

Check:

Expired SSL certificate

Wrong certificate chain

Ingress TLS misconfiguration

Certificate renewal failure (Cert-Manager)

⭐ Interview Golden Line:
“First I check pod status, then describe, then logs, followed by node, service, and HPA depending on the issue.
