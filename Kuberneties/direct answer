What if traffic keeps increasing beyond what max replicas can handle?


“HPA scales the replicas only between min and max values.
If the traffic exceeds the capacity even after reaching max replicas, Kubernetes will not scale further and the application will start experiencing 
performance issues like latency and failed requests.
That’s why we use Cluster Autoscaler, VPA or multi-region scaling in production environments.”

why we go for deployment:
1-Real-world explanation

If your application gets updated from v1 to v2:

👉 ReplicaSet cannot update version
👉 Deployment updates pods without downtime, creates a new ReplicaSet internally, and rolls back if something breaks
ReplicaSet ensures the required number of Pods are running, while Deployment sits on top of ReplicaSet and adds rolling updates, rollbacks, and release strategies.
