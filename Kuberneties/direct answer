What if traffic keeps increasing beyond what max replicas can handle?


“HPA scales the replicas only between min and max values.
If the traffic exceeds the capacity even after reaching max replicas, Kubernetes will not scale further and the application will start experiencing 
performance issues like latency and failed requests.
That’s why we use Cluster Autoscaler, VPA or multi-region scaling in production environments.”
