“Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment and management. 
Instead of manually applying multiple YAML files for Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Ingress,  Helm allows these files to be bundled together into a
single package called a Helm Chart

A Helm Chart has a standard structure with Chart.yaml for metadata, values.yaml for configurations, templates/ for Kubernetes manifests 
with placeholders, and an optional charts/ folder for dependencies. This makes manifests reusable and parameterized,

so we only update values.yaml instead of editing every file.

In production, I go beyond the basics by templating resources like HPA for autoscaling, Secrets for credentials, PVC for persistence,
PodDisruptionBudget for high availability, NetworkPolicy for traffic restrictions, and RBAC for access control. Bundling these in one chart 
standardizes security, reliability, and performance across Dev, QA, and Prod. For example, I’ve deployed a Flask app with PostgreSQL using a 
single chart.

Helm also integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or ArgoCD, making deployments, upgrades, and rollbacks automated
and reliable. In one of my projects, I containerized a Flask app, built a Docker image, and deployed it with Helm.
All configs like replicas, image tags, and service types were in values.yaml, and Jenkins pipelines automatically built the image and 
upgraded the release on each commit. This gave us faster, consistent, and rollback-safe deployments, with advanced features like autoscaling 
and secure secrets management.

So overall, Helm reduces complexity, enforces consistency, improves scalability, and makes Kubernetes deployments production-ready.”

A typical Helm chart structure looks like this:

jio-stg-om-chart/
  ├── Chart.yaml        # Metadata about the chart
  ├── values.yaml       # Default configuration values for templates
  ├── charts/           # Subcharts (if any)
  └── templates/        # Template files for Kubernetes resources
      ├── deployment.yaml   
      ├── service.yaml
      └── pv.yaml

 Values.yaml 
---------------

You can customize deployments by creating your own values.yaml file, overriding default values in the chart:

stgvalues.yaml
----
replicaCount: 2
image:
  repository: my-repo/my-app
  tag: "1.0.0"
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
  port: 80
request:
 cpu: 1
 memory: 12Gi

prod-values.yaml
-----

replicaCount: 5
image:
  repository: my-repo/my-app-prod
  tag: "1.1.0"
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
  port: 80
request:
 cpu: 8
 memory: 128Gi
