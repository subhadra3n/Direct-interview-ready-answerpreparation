what jobs you have created:
“I’ve created CI/CD jobs in GitLab for building, testing, and deploying applications automatically to AWS environments. 
I’ve also built scheduled jobs to perform automated database backups, log rotation, and cleanup tasks. In Kubernetes, I created jobs for database migration, 
health checks, and canary deployments. Additionally, I’ve automated infrastructure
provisioning using Terraform, including scaling EC2/EKS resources based on metrics. All these jobs reduce manual intervention, improve uptime, and ensure faster delivery.
