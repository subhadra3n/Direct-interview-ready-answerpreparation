_______________________________________________________________
storing telling answer, below one gives if incident occurs how we solve them:


We manage incidents across infrastructure, application, deployment, and security layers.

For example:
we get incident tickets like
👉 Capacity issues –
We frequently handle OOM kills, high CPU usage, and disk full alerts in Kubernetes.
When this happens, we analyze pod metrics in Prometheus, check logs, resize resources, and  HPA tuning,scale nodes or pods to stabilize the system.

👉 Cloud outages –
We have managed AZ failures and DNS issues (Route53/CoreDNS).
In such cases, we perform traffic failover, update routing policies, and validate health checks to restore availability.

👉 Bad deployments –
Sometimes a canary or production release causes high 5xx errors or latency.
We immediately rollback, disable feature flags, analyze logs, fix the root cause, and redeploy safely.

👉 Traffic spikes (Thundering Herd) –
We’ve handled sudden surges that overwhelmed databases and caches.
We implemented rate limiting, connection pooling, and cache optimization to stabilize traffic.

👉 Application failures –
We troubleshoot cascading failures between microservices.
We tune timeouts, add circuit breakers, and improve service dependencies.

👉 Security incidents –
We mitigate DDoS attacks and WAF blocks.
We also fix expired SSL certificates and rotated secrets breaking service communication.



“Our main focus is quick detection, impact reduction, root cause analysis, and preventive measures.”

1.What type of incidents we manage.?

1) Capacity & Infrastructure Incidents

OOM & Resource Exhaustion

Pods getting OOMKilled, CPU throttling, disk reaching 100%.

Actions: Right-sizing resources, HPA tuning, node scaling, log cleanup, PVC expansion.

Cloud & Network Outages

Availability Zone failures, ELB health issues, DNS problems (Route53/CoreDNS).

Actions: Traffic failover, updating health checks, validating routing policies.

2) Deployment & Traffic Incidents

Bad Releases

Canary or production deployments causing 5xx errors, latency spikes.

Actions: Rollbacks, feature flag disable, root cause analysis.

Thundering Herd Problem

Sudden spike in DB connections or cache misses overwhelming backend.

Actions: Rate limiting, connection pooling, cache warming.

3) Application Performance Issues

Cascading Failures

One microservice failure impacting multiple downstream services.

Actions: Circuit breakers, timeout tuning, bulkhead pattern.

Database Locks & Thread Starvation

Row locks, thread pool exhaustion blocking transactions.

Actions: Query optimization, index tuning, increasing pool limits.

4) Security & Connectivity Incidents

Traffic Anomalies / DDoS

Sudden malicious traffic spikes.

Actions: WAF rules, IP blocking, autoscaling.

Credential & Certificate Failures

Expired SSL certs, rotated secrets breaking communication.

Actions: Secret rotation, cert automation (ACM/Cert-Manager).
