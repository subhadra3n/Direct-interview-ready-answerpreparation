It is a logically isolated private network in AWS where you can launch and manage cloud resources securely.
_______________________
what is subnet
A subnet is a logical subdivision of a VPC’s IP address range, placed within a specific Availability Zone, 
used to organize resources, control traffic, and launch instances securely.
_____________________
what is public subnet
public subnet has direct internet access through IGW,
Instances launched in a public subnet can send and receive traffic from the internet IGW, typically used for web servers, bastion hosts, or load balancers.
__________________
what is private subnet
private subnet in vpc doesn't have direct,Instances in a private subnet access the internetthrough a NAT Gateway or NAT instance in a public subnet. 
_______________________
what is IGW
IGW is attached to a VPC and, together with route tables, enables public subnets to send and receive traffic from the internet.
_______________________________---
What is NAT
A NAT allows instances in private subnets to access the internet without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.
_____________
what is route table
“A route table tells a subnet where to send its traffic.”

Security Group (SG)

Virtual firewall attached to instances; controls inbound & outbound traffic.

Network ACL (NACL)

Subnet-level firewall; stateless; controls inbound/outbound traffic.
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

Defines IP address range of a VPC or subnet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).

Availability Zone (AZ)

Isolated data center within a region; used for high availability.

Elastic IP (EIP)

Static public IPv4 for instances in public subnet.

VPC Peering

One-to-one VPC-to-VPC connection in same region.

Transit Gateway (TGW)

Hub to connect multiple VPCs or on-prem networks; supports cross-region & multi-account.

VPC Endpoint / PrivateLink

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB/ALB/NLB)

Distributes traffic across instances; can be public or internal.
